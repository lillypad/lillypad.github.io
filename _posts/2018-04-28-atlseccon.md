I did a presentation Chrome extension malware development at the conference this year (`2018-04-28`).

I've received great comments about my talk and how it opened people's eyes to the state of the browser extension ecosystem. It's really become a `dumpster-fire`. After proving my point with the demo of the malware people thought this was very facinating it's this easy to understand.

It was also great to engage people with only front end development experience as some of them do wish to progress into the wild world of cyber security.

I've had a request to appy to `SecTor` as well as `BSides Calgary` for this talk as well. If travel is covered this is definitly something I'm considering.

For those who don't have GitHub you can view the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/lillypad/the-chrome-crusader).

There was a lot of talk at the conference about the `foipop` "breach" even `CBC News` attended the conference to learn about opinions the security industry has.

I didn't happen to find out the number of swag that was sold but I did over hear that stickers and t-shirts were purchased and the money when to support the young mans defense.

[Brian Brushwood](http://www.shwood.com/) attended the conference and did a wonderful job of keeping everyone engaged with his magic tricks. It really made the conference stand out and make it very entertaining.

It was fantastic.

A total of `702` in attendance this year making it the biggest one yet.

I can't wait to see what 2019 has in store for `AtlSecCon`.

I will also be doing a rehash of my presentation on Chrome extension malware for [Girls Power Tech](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/csr/stories/girls-power-tech.html). Which hopefully will aid in getting more women like myself into the Cyber Security industry. This will be on `2018-05-03` and if you haven't signed up yet it would be a good idea to inquire about attending.

Hoping all you hackers out there are looking forward to it too.
