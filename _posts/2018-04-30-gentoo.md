I thought I'd start posting some of my experiences with Gentoo as I continue along with it in hopes that it will help some new people.

Gentoo just released `4.9.95-gentoo` (the kernel) as stable for `x86_64`.

For those looking to upgrade and have fully encrypted root it's as simple as doing the following:

```bash
# Switch to root user
su root
# Backup the current kernel config
cp /usr/src/linux/.config ~/kernel-config-`uname -r`
# Select the kernel (sets proper symlink)
eselect kernel list
eselect kernel set 2
# Copy old config over to new source
cp /boot/config-4.9.76-gentoo-r1 /usr/src/linux/.config
cd /usr/src/linux/
# Convert old config to new config
make olddefconfig
# Build Kernel
make
# Install modules
make modules_install
# Generate the initramfs
genkernel --lvm --luks --install initramfs
# Install Kernel to /boot
make install
# Configure Grub Bootloader for new Kernel Update
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

```

Hope this helps others out there who don't have the experience as of yet to compile their own kernels.

I also setup my `weechat` so I can talk in slack via this [plugin](https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack).

To get this working in `gentoo` with weechat I had to remove the `python` targets for `python` version `3.5`.

Still with weechat plugins using `python` 3.0 and greater are considered experimental and the slack plugin is not.

I had to install `websocket-client`.

```bash
pip2 install --user websocket-client
```

You can see use flags with `equery` as well modify use flags for specific applications using `flaggie`.

To install these tools do:
```bash
sudo emerge --ask app-portage/gentoolkit \
    app-portage/flaggie
```

I will probably update here regularly which different `gentoo` related topics.
