  \section{Summary}
  In Cyber Security it's important to be versed in many different skill sets. To facilitate this skill set I've taken all Advanced Placement courses throughout High School and achieved Honors, took one year of Computer Science and four years of Engineering throughout University, have taken an additional nine courses in correspondence highlighting on White Hat Hacking, Web Application Security Testing, Security+ and Networking, also continuing my technical knowledge by reading books like The Shellcoders Handbook, Hacking the Art of Exploitation and Web Application Hackers Handbook..

I'm familiar with the PCI Compliance methodology and I'm able to determine if a business meets SAQ A, B, C or D. I'm able to work with ASV's to get external scans completed that meet compliance requirements as well.

I've done public relations as well delivering presentations to the consumer market as well as the private sector at the Atlantic Security Conference. These presentations include live hacking demonstrations and remediation proof of concept work. These demonstrations have included Lock Picking, SQL Injection, Buffer Overflows, Remote Exploitation, Malware, WiFi Exploitation, XSS, and more.

I also make hacking tools in my spare time one called Chameleon and one called Badger. Chameleon is a base64 Stenography Tool with Advanced Key Options and can be incorporated into AV Evasion Projects, Badger is a Windows Exploit Development Tool designed to allow easier enumeration of DEP, SEH, and ASLR protections.
